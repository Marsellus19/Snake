# Snake
This is an interpretation of the infamous snake game made for Computer Programming classes (CP2) at the Silesian University of Technology.

The game is rather straight forward and intuitive. Use arrow keys and the return key to navigate menus and play the game. There's no goal to reach. Just play until you die.

You can choose between 4 difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Extreme and Ridiculous.
They alter the speed the snake moves at.

A quick disclaimer. This game was written in XCode on macOS and therefore as of right now it works on mac only. With some minor changes it should however compile on Windows as well, although I haven't tried that.
